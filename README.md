# Elevate-Labs-Task-3
Perform Vulnerability scanning on system and find active critical vulnerabilities in the system.

This task will be done through the use of Nessus Essentials which can be activated for a free trail for a month. This will allow us to use the software which can be used to perform a full vulnerability scan on the selected IP address. 
The scan will executed on a desktop and the found vulnerabilities can be addressed through the necessary remedies.
